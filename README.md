## Description

Our app serves as a platform where software developers can make a beautiful resume and save it as a PDF file and where companies looking for developers can search for a specific tech skill and it's level. Companies can also send a personal message to developers.

## Instructions

<br></br>

### **For developers**

DevJobs is a very easy to use app, after you have registered you'll be directed to the dashboard, there you'll have two options, either click on messages and check if you have received any mail from companies or click on resume. On the page resume you'll be able to create your resume and print it as a pdf.

<br></br>

### **For companies**

As a company representative after you have registered you'll be able to search developers with a specific tech skill and it's level. After that you'll be able to select the candidate that interests you by clicking on the name in the card. After that you'll get to see their resume, save it as a pdf file and you'll also have the option of sending them a message.

## Motivation

</div>

Our motivation came from the experience one of us had of companies on linkedin asking for him to send his resume on pdf format, it took him a couple of hours to do it from scratch, now with Devjobs any developer can make a resume in 10 minutes.

## Technologies

</div>

This application was build with react, we also used axios, react-router-dom, react-hook-form, yup, react-toastify, react-icons, react-select and JWT-decode libraries.

## Challenges

</div>

It was a challenge to implement the resume edition and the search for developers with specific tech skills because as we have not yet learned back-end development we made use of Json-server, therefore a fake API, which has many limitations.

<div align ="center">

## Future features

</div>

We hope that in future we can implement the option of having different resume layouts for the developer to choose from, that the developer receives a message on his email telling when a company has view his resume and when someone send a message.
